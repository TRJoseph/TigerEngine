# Getting Started
To get started as a developer on this project, we need to ensure a few things are installed on your pc.

First of all, the **Unity Editor** is required for viewing the game scene and interacting with the visual aspects of the game.
This can be found here: [Unity](https://unity.com/download)

Unity requires a license in order to use. This can be obtained through a partnering organization/university or instead, if you prefer, you can simply use a free personal license.

Once the latest version of the editor is installed, make sure to install your preferred IDE to view the codebase. I highly reccomend either [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) as these both contain optional Unity extensions that aid in the development process.

Once these are installed, clone the repository to your desired directory (this will require you to be a collaborator of the project on github), and open the project in your code editor and the Unity Editor. When installing Unity, you are typically reccomended to use Unity Hub as sort of a central location to view all your projects. This is not necessary but I do recommend it.
